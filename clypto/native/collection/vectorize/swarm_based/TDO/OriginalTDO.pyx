    Notes:
        1. This is somewhat concerning, as there appears to be a high degree of similarity between the source code for this algorithm and the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA)
        2. Algorithm design is similar to Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA), Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA), Pelican optimization algorithm (POA), Siberian Tiger Optimization (STO), Language Education Optimization (LEO), Serval Optimization Algorithm (SOA), Walrus Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Fennec Fox Optimization (FFO), Three-periods optimization algorithm (TPOA), Teamwork optimization algorithm (TOA), Northern goshawk optimization (NGO), Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA), Archery algorithm (AA), Cat and mouse based optimizer (CMBO)
        3. It may be useful to compare the Matlab code of this algorithm with those of the similar algorithms to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
        4. The article may share some similarities with previous work by the same authors, further investigation may be warranted to verify the benchmark results reported in the papers and ensure their reliability and accuracy.

    >>> from clypto.collection.swarm_based import TDO    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from clypto import FloatVar
    >>>
    >>> def objective_function(solution):
    >>>     return np.sum(solution**2)
    >>>
    >>> problem_dict = {
    >>>     "bounds": FloatVar(lb=(-10.,) * 30, ub=(10.,) * 30, name="delta"),
    >>>     "minmax": "min",
    >>>     "obj_func": objective_function
    >>> }
    >>>
    >>> model = TDO.OriginalTDO(epoch=1000, pop_size=50)
    >>> g_best = model.solve(problem_dict)
    >>> print(f"Solution: {g_best.solution}, Fitness: {g_best.target.fitness}")
    >>> print(f"Solution: {model.g_best.solution}, Fitness: {model.g_best.target.fitness}")
